## Getting started

You can run and edit the algorithms or contribute to them using [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/), a free online development environment, with a single click.

## Contributing New Algorithms
	
* Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of contributing "several algorithms" all at once contribute them all one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "Logistic Regression", another one for "K-Means", and so on).

* Every new algorithm must have:
	* **Source code** with comments and readable namings
	* **Math** being explained in README.md along with the code
	* **Jupyter demo notebook** with an example of how this new algorithm may be applied

If you're adding new **datasets** they need to be saved in the `/data` folder. CSV files are preferable. The size of the file should not be greater than `30Mb`.

## Contributing

Before removing any bug, or adding new algorithms please read our **[Contribution Guidelines](Contributing.md)** and our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
